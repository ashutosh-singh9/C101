#Basic & History

C is the 'mother of all modern programming languages’

1960s: Programs written in Assembly Language
CPL (Combined Programming Language) → too complex
BCPL (Basic CPL) → simplified by Martin Richards (1967)
B Language (1969) → created by Ken Thompson at Bell Labs

Birth of C (1972)
• Developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs
• Created to develop UNIX in a high-level language
• C came after B → hence the name 'C'

C and UNIX
• Initially UNIX was in Assembly
• 1973: UNIX rewritten in C
• Result: Portability, efficiency, popularity of C

Why Learn C Today?
• Foundation of many languages (C++, Java, Python)
• Used in OS, embedded systems, compilers, databases
• It is still widely used because of its power, speed, and closeness to hardware.

Timeline Recap 
• 1960s: CPL → BCPL → B 
• 1969: Ken Thompson created B 
• 1972: Dennis Ritchie created C 
• 1973: UNIX rewritten in C 
• 1978: K&R C published 
• 1989: ANSI C standardized 
• 1999+: C99, C11, C17 updates
